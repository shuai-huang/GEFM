If you use this code and find it helpful, please cite the above paper. Thanks:)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The code is written in MATLAB:
    1) The folder "code" contains the functions to perform sparse signal recovery using different approaches: \|x\|_1 minimization, \|\vx\|_p^p  minimization, generalized shannon entropy function minimization, generalized renyi entropy function minimization, L_1/L_infinity, logarithm of energy, iterative hard thresholding, OMP, CoSaMP
    2) The folder "sara_weight" contains the funtions to perform image recovery from linear measurements
    3) "noiseless_signal_recovery.m" contains examples to perform noiseless recovery.
    4) "noisy_signal_recovery.m" contains examples to perform noisy recovery.
    5) "image_recovery.m" contains examples to perform image recovery via sparsity averaging.
    6) "face_recognition.m" contains examples to use SRC to perform face recognition.
